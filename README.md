Contributions:
    1. Fork the project:
    
    A "fork" is a copy of the project in your GitHub account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original project.
    2. Clone the "fork" to your computer:
    
    This allows you to work on the project locally.
    3. Create a branch ("branch") for your changes:
    
    It's a good practice to create a separate branch for each change you make. This makes it easier to review and integrate your changes.
    4. Make the changes:
    
    Modify the project files with any improvements or fixes you want to make.
    5. Commit the changes:
    
    A "commit" is a record of the changes you've made. Write descriptive messages to explain what you changed.
    6. Put the changes in your "fork":
    
    This updates your fork with the changes you made locally.
    7. Send a "pull request":
    
    A pull request is a request to incorporate your changes into the original project. 
    The project manager will review your changes and accept them (or ask you to make changes) if everything is correct.
    
    Additional tips:
    Read the project instructions: Many projects have a README or CONTRIBUTING file with specific instructions for contributing.
    
    Communicate with those responsible for the project: If you have doubts or questions, do not hesitate to contact them.
    Be respectful and constructive: Collaboration on open source projects is a community activity.
    Don't get discouraged if your changes aren't accepted the first time: Code review is an iterative process.
